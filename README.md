# Remembrance of Monocotyledons using Residual Networks
## Abstract
Plant identification has a wide range of applications in the field of agriculture, ethnopharmacology, horticulture. There are existing systems that identify the plant using leaf images. Since leaves are one of the distinguishable feature of a plant, they are routinely used for identification by prediction based Machine learning algorithms or by performing trait segmentation by extracting information from plantâ€™s leaf. As the structure and features of the leaf may be affected by various stages of leaves, different colors during stages, torn leaves etc. So instead using a leaf image, entire plant image is far convincing approach. Dataset is prepared The proposed system recognizes the respective species of monocot by capturing the whole image. Images of these monocots are collected manually. As the count of collected images are less in number, Image Augmentation is used to generate new images with different perspectives. A neural network is used for feature extraction and to identify the plant. As the image contains a lot of features needed to be extracted, we need a neural network which is suitable. Residual Networks (ResNet) is a worthy approach as it is a way to handle the vanishing gradient problem in very deep CNNs. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 99.3% using ResNet-50.
